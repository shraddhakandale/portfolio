            I'm a Software Engineering Specialist with over 3 years of hands-on
            experience crafting scalable and interactive web applications. I
            specialize in Drupal CMS, React.js, Redux Toolkit, and bring strong
            skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Throughout my journey, I've
            successfully built and deployed 10+ dynamic web pages, seamlessly
            integrating REST APIs, and implementing robust patterns like state
            management and efficient API fetching. I blend clean code with
            thoughtful UX to deliver solutions that are both functional and
            user-friendly.
